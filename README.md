# Image-Segementation-using-LM-filters

Further improved implementation available [here](https://github.com/BATspock/Textons-colors)


Segments image using LM filters and K Means

The script takes as input path to image, number of clusters for k-Means and number of iterations as input

To run the script 
```
python textonv4.py "path_to_image" "number of clusters" "number of iterations"
```

Example
```
python textonv4.py home/imagesfolder/exapmle.jpg 7 100
```
